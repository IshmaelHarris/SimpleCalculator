# Simple Calculator in C#

## Overview
The Simple Calculator is a console-based application written in C#. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulus, and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan). The calculator is designed to be user-friendly and robust, handling user inputs and errors gracefully.

## Features
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

- Advanced Mathematical Operations: The calculator supports exponentiation, modulus, and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).

- User Interface: The calculator has a simple and intuitive console-based user interface. It prompts the user for inputs and displays the result of the calculation.

- Error Handling: The calculator handles invalid inputs and mathematical errors (like division by zero) gracefully, displaying appropriate error messages to the user.

- Continuous Calculations: The calculator allows users to perform continuous calculations on a result, enabling the creation of longer equations.

- Unit Testing: The calculator includes a set of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the calculations.

## Usage
To use the calculator, simply run the application. You will be prompted to enter the first number, an operator, and a second number. After the calculation is performed, the result will be displayed. You will then have the option to perform another operation on this result or start a new calculation.
